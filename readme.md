# About

This project helps you reach that ever elusive word count.

Please understand that you should read over the essay after it is submitted, to make sure it sounds correct and edit where needed. This isn't a perfect program, plus proofreading is good for writing papers.

# How to use

Download the project to your desktop, and copy your essay into a .txt document.

Open your terminal, type "cd desktop/essayfluff".

Then hit "ls". This should print out the files in the essayfluff folder. You should see an output like "homework.rb, word.txt, readme.md"

If not, you made a mistake. Consider picking up a book and working on your reading comprehension.

Once you are in the right folder, type "ruby homework.rb"

Boom! It is finished!

Copy from the .txt file, into your original file. 

Reread file to ensure grammatical perfection.

Consider your life choices that allowed you to fail in your ability to write a basic essay that reaches a word count.

Consider yourself a failure.

Congratulate yourself, if this is your first time using a terminal.

You are still a failure though.

I know I sound like your father. Shut up and clean your room.
